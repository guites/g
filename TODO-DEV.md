1. Clone gchan-backend [x]
2. Create a dummy db dump file based on the dump from heroku [x]
3. Create a postgres docker config that loads the dump on creation: [source](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md) [x]
4. Once devcontainer part is ok, create a bash script that will load the necessary env vars and docker-compose up/down, delete created containers/images? [ ]
5. Implement a check on the backend to only verify captcha if env == production [ ]
